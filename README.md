## Rules
### Playing the game
To get started, click on the pile in the top left of the board to draw a card.
Using your cursor, drag and drop cards into their available positions:
- Any card can be placed under a card that is 1 above them in the card order. The cards must be alternating colours between black and red
- For the card at the top of the order (the queen), this can be placed on an empty row
- Aces can be placed in the 4 slots in the right of the board, given that it is the correct suit

### Winning
Once all the cards in the pile you draw from have been placed, and all cards face-down have been turned around, you win!

Now you can play another game or exit.

Make sure to take notice of the move number and time to see if you can do better next time.
